- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **If there is any error output in the temrinal, include that output with your report.**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Did the problem start happening recently** or was this always a problem?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to The Community Building Handbook? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/EllaKaye/community-building-handbook/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/EllaKaye/community-building-handbook/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible version of The Community Building Handbook
- Enable a sustainable system for The Community Building Handbook's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. **Describe clearly what is the purpose of the pull request**. Refer to the relevant issues on [Bugs](#reporting-bugs) or
2. [Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements). In general, an issue should always be open *prior* to a pull request, to discuss
3. its contents with a maintainer and make sure it makes sense for The Community Building Handbook. If the pull request is a work in progress
4. that will take some time to be ready but still you want to discuss it with the community, open a
5. [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
6. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, 
the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
